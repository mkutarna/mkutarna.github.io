			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Making things</b>. A broad statement: I am often designing and putting together new ideas - 3D printing, waterjetting, hand tool woodworking, etc. I was able to attend the International Symposium on Academic Makerspaces @ Yale in 2019.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Amateur radio</b>. I've been interested in electronics and communication since I was young - but only as an adult am I diving into the word of amateur radio communication. I am studying for my advanced license, in order to begin designing and building my own equipment.
			  <li>
				  <b>Hiking</b>. As a lifeline hiker, living in the Lower Mainland has provided many opportunities to get out into the wilderness. I enjoy taking my family to explore what nature has hidden away in the area.
      </li>

          I'm designing, building and testing a VHF/UHF receiver to expand my skills in RF design (using Altium) and assembly (printing PCB via Voltera printer). This will be one building block a larger APRS-equipped transceiver project.
