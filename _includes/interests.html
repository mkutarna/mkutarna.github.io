			<ul>
			  <li>
        <b>Making things</b>. A broad statement; I am often designing and 
        putting together new ideas - 3D printing, prototyping, hand tool 
        woodworking, etc. I recently attended the 
        <a href="https://isam2019.hemi-makers.org/">International Symposium on Academic Makerspaces 2019 @ Yale</a>.

			  <li>
	<b>Amateur radio</b>. I've been interested in electronics and 
        communication since I was young - but only as an adult am I diving into 
        the world of amateur radio communication. I am studying for my advanced 
        certification, in order to begin designing and building my own equipment.
			  <li>
	<b>Hiking</b>. As a lifeline hiker, living in the Lower Mainland has 
        provided many opportunities to get out into the wilderness. I enjoy 
        taking my family to explore what nature has hidden away in the area.

		  <ul>
  			<li>
        <b>Electronics schedule display</b>. A display for meeting rooms and 
        teaching labs to replace paper schedules. Based on a RPi3, this display 
        fetches data from a meeting room booking system to show up-to-date 
        information at the door.
             		</li>
  			<li>

        <b>Custom VHF/UHF receiver</b>. I'm designing, building and testing a 
        VHF/UHF receiver to expand my skills in RF design (using Altium) and 
        assembly (printing PCB via Voltera printer). This will be one building 
        block a larger <a href="http://www.aprs.org/">APRS</a>-equipped transceiver project.
    		</li>
  			<li>
        <b>Pikler triangle</b>. Hand built a folding, pine-and-maple Pikler 
        triangle for my children to enjoy inside during the wet, grey months of 
        Vancouver-area winter.
