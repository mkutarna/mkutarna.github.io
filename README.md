This is a one-page bio for hosting highlights, interests, and projects for professional pursuits - as well as providing an easy contact method.

This is based on Chuck Groom's [One Page Bio theme](https://github.com/chuckgroom/onepage-bio), itself a heavily pared-down version Jerome Lachaud's [Freelancer Jekyll theme](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme). Jerome's original theme is well-suited for designers to easily assemble a portfolio site of their visual work; this is a prose-centric version tailored to software developers. [formspree](http://formspree.io/) is used for the contact form.
